Project Part: #1: Create Repository

Intro:

	This project part consists of building the first portion of our SCM (Source Code Management) project in Java with a development team. Only the initial use-case: Create Repo is implemented.

External Requirements: None

Build, Installation, and Setup:

	In order for the program to run two folders should exist on the user's computer. One folder, which must be populated with other folders and files, acts as the source folder. The second folder, which must be empty, acts as the target folder to place the created repository.

Usage:

	When the program is ran the user is prompted through the console to "Enter the source tree path:". Here the user must provide the full source path to the original project to be copied into the repository. The user must press enter/return when finished. A new prompt pops up on the console asking the user to "Enter target repo folder path:". Here the user must provide the full target path to the repository folder and press enter/return when finished. The program will then run and output to the console "repo created" if successful.

Extra Features: None
